# 🔥 ANN Regression – Predicting Power Plant Output  

This project demonstrates the use of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for solving a **regression problem** on the **Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) dataset** from the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).  
The goal is to predict the **net electrical energy output** of the plant based on environmental and operational factors.

## 🚀 Features  
- Implements a fully connected **Artificial Neural Network** for regression  
- Trained on the **CCPP dataset** with multiple input features (Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, etc.)  
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like **MSE, RMSE, and R² score**  
- Clean, modular code for training and evaluation
